we wanted 
of our souls 
in our halls 
in our cups 
along the road 
amid the waves 
over the cliffs 
inside the doors 
beyond the clouds 
we were 
we were 
they were 
they had 
we had 
we heard 
we tell of 
was wasted 
we squandered 
the men had 
the women wanted 
the enemies brought 
we did not have 
they did not give 
we presented 
we sent
