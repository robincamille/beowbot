Examples of lines:
> This word-message we shout: the destroyed seas,        and we served the elf we heard 

>To warriors will be granted din-frost,        the width of our thread-sword

>The sea glistened with sang hands,        and we wrecked the skull we were 

>When war assaults, we serve begeared frosts,        and we gave the scuttling we heard 

>Serpent-water amid the waves,        the famous king's strength

>A great mess made of the caught promises,        and we bestowed the targe in our cups 

>The road was littered with weeded ealdorman.        But we fight for misbegotten word

>So to the besmirchers of meadhall,        will come when comes the slew cloud

>We have heard of the glory-demon,        the road was littered with terror-den

>The road was littered with besmirched Danes,        and we spent the dew they were 

>Drink down this cup of traveled strengths,        and we embraced the frost they had 

>O'er the way of the destroyed sufferings,        and we kissed the being we were 

>Our children will sing of the wound -helm,        the width of our shade-revenge

>A great mess made of the wearied darknesss,        and we worked the king in our halls
